# NYC-GO!

The title of this project "NYC-GO!" was inspired by a popular mobile phone game 
"Pokemon GO!". The idea behind Pokemon Go was to have people go outside and 
catch difference pokemon whilst exploriing different places. My project NYC-GO! 
is also aim to make people go outside of their house and explore the city more.

One of the biggest reason why people stay at home instead of going outside is 
because their friends are busy or they just simply doesn't have friends avalible.
Therefore on the "NYC-GO!" page would have two button you can choose to filter
activities that is good for one person or multiple people. There are critirias for
which actitivity would be more suitable for one person. For example, the activities
would require less interaction with others and the activities won't let the person 
feel more lonely or embarassed. 

In the project I would use Javascript for the frontend for the filters and Rails f
or the backend to store datas of the activities. For the map I would use the 
google map API or other map API available.
