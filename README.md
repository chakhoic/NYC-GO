# NYC-GO!

The title of this project "NYC-GO!" was inspired by a popular mobile phone game 
"Pokemon GO!". The idea behind Pokemon Go was to have people go outside and 
catch difference pokemon whilst exploriing different places. My project NYC-GO! 
is also aim to make people go outside of their house and explore the city more.

One of the biggest reason why people stay at home instead of going outside is 
because their friends are busy or they just simply doesn't have friends avalible.
Therefore on the "NYC-GO!" page would have two button you can choose to filter
activities that is good for one person or multiple people. There are critirias for
which actitivity would be more suitable for one person. 

Fuctionality

In this project I used the google map api. The google map api allow me render google map for the specific location and allow me to drop pins on the google map. Once you click on the pin it will show you the details of the activities.
