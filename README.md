# NYC-GO!

NYC-GO! is a project inspired by the wildly popular mobile game, Pokemon GO! The game's premise was simple: players were encouraged to go outside, explore their surroundings, and capture different Pokemon. Similarly, the goal of NYC-GO! is to inspire people to venture outside and experience everything that the city has to offer.

One of the biggest obstacles to going out and exploring can be the lack of available companions. With this in mind, the NYC-GO! page features two filter options, allowing users to select activities that are ideal for either solo adventurers or groups. Certain criteria have been put in place to determine which activities are best suited for solo exploration.

## How to use

  1. Use the filter options to find places in New York City that fit your criteria.
  2. Select a filtered location from the drop-down menu to view details and its location on the map.
  3. Enjoy your adventure!

## Fuctionality

To create NYC-GO, I utilized a variety of tools and technologies, including JavaScript, Webpack, npm, CSS, and SCSS. To filter the activities displayed on the page, I created three filters that are dependent on the last filter selected. These filters help users find the activities that best suit their needs, whether they are looking to explore the city on their own or with friends. To display the locations of the activities on a map, I used the Google Maps API to drop markers at each location. When a user clicks on a marker, they can see more information about the activity, including its name, description, and location. This functionality makes it easy for users to find and plan their ideal NYC adventure. Additionally, users can drag the little human icon from Google Maps to the desired location, and the street view of that place will be displayed. This feature provides users with a more immersive experience, allowing them to get a sense of what the location looks like before visiting.
